# Cara-s-Macropad
my awesome DIY macropad for the hackpad project. Using a screen OLED, 6 switchs, a EC11 and some LEDs

## CAD

I know what you're thinking. and I agree with you it's not very handsome.
BUT I discover this project less than a week ago and with a deadline of January 1 and Christmas, New years.... I don't have time to really make a nice case ;-;

The inserts for the screws do not appear here, but they will of course be added before printing.

However, I am motivated to improve this CAD after the holidays.

I used Solidworks because Fusion is... is Fusion :)

in french we often say "en sah Fusion ca pue sa mère quand meme"

to explain a little bit about what I have in my mind :

I draw this, and the final version should look like this with the UwU logo on the right

## PCB 
I used KiCad and I tried to make a compact pcb(under 10 x 10cm) with private jokes with my friends and a logo with my nickname "Cara"

IMPORTANT POINT !!!!!
you can see on the electrical sketch that I used some Leds but they do not appear on the PCB that's normal
I added an output for the LEDs below the encoder. I want to use the Leds around the pcb to make an effect that diffuse the light with a fit layer of PLA
So the LEDs should not appear on the PCB.

## Firmware

I'm not good at Pyhton so I asked my friends Pylou to help me with the code
It's pretty simple right now but I would improve everything once I have the card in my hand.
maybe change the language from python to C.

## BOM

Here's the list of parts for my project!

 - 1x Seeed XIAO RP2040
 - 6x Through-hole 1N4148 Diodes
 - 6x MX-Style switches
 - 1x EC11 Rotary encoders
 - 1x 0.91 inch OLED displays
 - 6x Blank DSA keycaps (White)
 - 14x SK6812 MINI-E LEDs
 - 4x M3x16mm screws
 - 4x M3x5mx4mm heatset inserts
 - 1x 3D printed case: not shure about the color
 - 1x PCB
